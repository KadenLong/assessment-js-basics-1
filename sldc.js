// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

const analysisOfRequirements = `After planning it is important to review what code you may already have. That cde could be of use. Then, determine what code is needs to be created to build the features you are looking for.`;

const design = `This step is crucial. the design step is used to plan the actual code and control flow. Skipping this step will more likely than not result in a bunch of buggy code.`;

const implementation = `during this step, the different features of the application are written and put together`;

const testingAndIntegration = `Once the application is created, it needs to be put to the test thouroghly. Taking the time to test before intergration reduces the risk of code breaking bugs. Once the application proves successful, it can be integrated into whatever live deployment the application is for.`;

const maintain = `Less of a step, but more of the aftermath post-deployment. Any application will encounter preformance issues thorughout its life. Developers often work on maintain an application: fix bugs / optimize code / maximize preformance`;
